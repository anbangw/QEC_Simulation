    "Modelled error sources:\n",
    " - p_meas: measurement flip (ancilla readout) -> time-like edges between same check across rounds.\n",
    " - p_1q: single-qubit X error probability per data qubit per round (from 1q gates / idle).\n",
    " - p_cx: per-CX probability that the CX produces a data-X on the involved data qubit.\n",
    " - p_cx_corr: per-pair-CX-correlated-X probability (two neighboring data qubits simultaneously get X)\n",

    "   The code assumes each such CX is counted once per measurement round for that check.\n",
